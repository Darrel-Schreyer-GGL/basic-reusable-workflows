# basic-reusable-workflows

This repository demonstrates the basic concepts of a reusable composite action that passes a variable from the caller action to the reusable actions.

This repo contains 3 different reusable actions:
- greeter
- reusable
- salutation

The actions are tested by being called from the test.yml file.

I suggest you fork the repo so that you can run the actions to see what they do.
