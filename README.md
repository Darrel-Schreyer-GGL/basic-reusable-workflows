# basic-reusable-workflows

This repository demonstrates the basic concepts of a reusable composite action that passes a variable from the main to the reusable action.

There are two .yml files:

- .github/workflows/main.yml
- .github/actions/reusable/action.yml


I suggest you fork the repo so that you can run the actions to see what they do.
